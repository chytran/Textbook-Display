# Textbook-Display

This is an assignment in which textbooks will be displayed with their corresponding information to give the user an experience. The program displays
the Course #, Course title, Book Image, Book Title, and the price for each textbook. In addition, users can find a detailed description of each textbook
by manually clicking on the image and it will direct the user to another page with a more detailed description.

To use this code, edit your database info in:
-database.php 

If you do not have the proper sql database, it will not work also.
